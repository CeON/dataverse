"We encourage anyone interested in building tools that interoperate with "
"Dataverse to utilize our APIs. The Dataverse community has supplied :doc"
":`client-libraries` for Python, R, and Java and we are always interested "
"in helping the community develop libraries for additional languages. The "
":doc:`apps` section links to open source Javascript, PHP, Python, and "
"Java code that you can learn from while developing against Dataverse "
"APIs."

msgid "We document the Dataverse API in five sections:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/api/intro.rst:18
msgid ""
":doc:`sword`: For depositing data using a standards-based approach rather"
" than the :doc:`native-api`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/api/intro.rst:19
msgid ":doc:`search`: For searching dataverses, datasets, and files."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/api/intro.rst:20
msgid ":doc:`dataaccess`: For downloading and subsetting data."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/api/intro.rst:21
msgid ":doc:`native-api`: For performing most tasks that are possible in the GUI."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/api/intro.rst:22
msgid ""
":doc:`metrics`: For query statisics about usage of a Dataverse "
"installation."

#: ../../source/api/intro.rst:24
msgid ""
"We use the term \"native\" to mean that the API is not based on any "
"standard. For this reason, the :doc:`search` and :doc:`dataaccess` could "
"also be considered \"native\" and in the future we may reorganize the API"
" Guide to split the :doc:`native-api` section into \"Datasets API\", "
"\"Files\" API, etc."

"Most Dataverse APIs require the use of an API token. (In code we "
"sometimes call it a \"key\" because it's shorter.) Instructions for "
"getting a token are described in the :doc:`/user/account` section of the "
"User Guide."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/api/intro.rst:31
msgid ""
"There are two ways to pass your API token to Dataverse APIs. The "
"preferred method is to send the token in the ``X-Dataverse-key`` HTTP "
"header, as in the following curl example::"

#: ../../source/api/intro.rst:35
msgid ""
"Throughout this guide you will often see Bash shell envionmental "
"variables being used, like this::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/api/intro.rst:40
msgid ""
"The second way to pass your API token is via an extra query parameter "
"called ``key`` in the URL like this::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/api/intro.rst:44
msgid ""
"Use of the ``X-Dataverse-key`` HTTP header form is preferred because "
"putting the query parameters in URLs often results in them finding their "
"way into web server access logs. Your API token should be kept as secret "
"as your password because it can be used to perform any action *as you* in"
" the Dataverse application."

msgid ""
"If you are using the APIs for an installation of Dataverse hosted by your"

#: ../../source/api/intro.rst:61
msgid ""
"APIs described in this guide are shipped with the Dataverse software "
"itself. Additional APIs are available if someone at your institution "
"installs the \"miniverse\" application from "
"https://github.com/IQSS/miniverse and gives it read only access to a "
"production Dataverse database. http://dataverse.org/metrics is powered by"
" miniverse."
