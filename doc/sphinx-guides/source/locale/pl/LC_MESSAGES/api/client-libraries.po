"Currently there are client libraries for Python, R, and Java that can be "
"used to develop against Dataverse APIs. We use the term \"client "
"library\" on this page but \"Dataverse SDK\" (software development kit) "
"is another way of describing these resources. They are designed to help "
"developers express Dataverse concepts more easily in their programs and "
"applications. For support on any of these client libraries, please "
"consult each project's README."
