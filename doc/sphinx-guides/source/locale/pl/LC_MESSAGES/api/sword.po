"SWORD_ stands for \"Simple Web-service Offering Repository Deposit\" and "
"is a \"profile\" of AtomPub (`RFC 5023`_) which is a RESTful API that "
"allows non-Dataverse software to deposit files and metadata into a "
"Dataverse installation. :ref:`client-libraries` are available in Python, "
"Java, R, Ruby, and PHP."

"Introduced in Dataverse Network (DVN) `3.6 "
"<http://guides.dataverse.org/en/3.6.2/dataverse-api-main.html#data-"
"deposit-api>`_, the SWORD API was formerly known as the \"Data Deposit "
"API\" and ``data-deposit/v1`` appeared in the URLs. For backwards "
"compatibility these URLs continue to work (with deprecation warnings). "
"Due to architectural changes and security improvements (especially the "
"introduction of API tokens) in Dataverse 4.0, a few backward incompatible"
" changes were necessarily introduced and for this reason the version has "
"been increased to ``v1.1``. For details, see :ref:`incompatible`."
