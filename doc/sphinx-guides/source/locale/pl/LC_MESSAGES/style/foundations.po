"Foundation elements are the very basic building blocks to create a page "
"in Dataverse. Here we will outline how we've applied Bootstrap CSS to our"

"section includes links to relevant parts of the official Bootstrap guides"
" and other useful resources, where you can find more detailed "
"documentation. We will also outline other UI resources like FontCustom "
"and Socicon and how they are utilized."
