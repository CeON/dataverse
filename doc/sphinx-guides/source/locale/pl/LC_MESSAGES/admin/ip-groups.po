"IP Groups can be used to permit download of restricted files by IP "
"addresses rather than people. For example, you may want to allow "
"restricted files to be downloaded by researchers who physically enter a "
"library and make use of the library's network."

"IP Groups must be expressed as ranges in IPv4 or IPv6 format. For "
"illustrative purposes, here is a example of the entire IPv4 and IPv6 "
"range that you can :download:`download "
"<../_static/admin/ipGroupAll.json>` and edit to have a narrower range to "
"meet your needs. If you need your IP Group to only encompass a single IP "
"address, you must enter that IP address for the \"start\" and \"end\" of "
"the range. If you don't use IPv6 addresses, you can delete that section "
"of the JSON. Please note that the \"alias\" must be unique if you define "
"multiple IP Groups. You should give it a meaningful \"name\" since both "
"\"alias\" and \"name\" will appear and be searchable in the GUI when your"
" users are assigning roles."
