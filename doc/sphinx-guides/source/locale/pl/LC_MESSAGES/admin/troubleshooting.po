"... it most likely means that it is the JDBC driver incompatibility "
"that's preventing the timer from working correctly. Make sure you install"

"version 9.3 of PostgreSQL, make sure you have the driver "

"version of the driver. If you have an older driver in glassfish/lib, make"

":fixedwidthplain:`<GLASSFISH FOLDER>/glassfish/domains/domain1/generated`"
