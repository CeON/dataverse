"One of the optional components listed under \"Architecture and "
"Components\" in the :doc:`/installation/prep` section of the Installation"
" Guide is `Geoconnect <https://github.com/IQSS/geoconnect>`_, a piece of "
"middleware that allows Dataverse users to create maps in `WorldMap "
"<http://worldmap.harvard.edu>`_ based on geospatial data stored in "
"Dataverse. For more details on the feature from the user perspective, see"
" the :doc:`/user/data-exploration/worldmap` section of the User Guide."

"After a map has been created in WorldMap (assuming all the setup has been"
" done), an \"Explore\" button will appear next to the name of the file in"
" Dataverse. The \"Explore\" button should open the map in WorldMap. In "
"rare occasions, the map has been deleted on the WorldMap side such that "
"the \"Explore\" button goes nowhere, resulting in a dead link, a 404."

"Functionality has been added on the Dataverse side to iterate through all"
" the maps Dataverse knows about (stored in the ``maplayermetadata`` "
"database table) and to check for the existence of each map in WorldMap. "
"The status code returned from WorldMap (200, 404, etc.) is recorded in "
"Dataverse along with a timestamp of when the check was performed. To "
"perform this check, you can execute the following ``curl`` command::"

"The output will contain the ``layerLink`` being checked as well as the "

"field. 200 means OK and 404 means not found. 500 might indicate that the "
"map is only temporarily unavailable. The ``lastVerifiedStatus`` and "
"``lastVerifiedTime`` will be persisted to the ``maplayermetadata`` "

"Armed with this information about WorldMap returning a 404 for a map, you"
" may want to delete any record of the map on the Dataverse side so that "
"the \"Explore\" button goes away (and so that thumbnail files are cleaned"
" up). To accomplish this, use the following ``curl`` command, "
"substituting the id of the file::"

"End users can also run this command (if they have permission to edit the "

"cron so that Dataverse periodically checks on the status of maps in "
"WorldMap. In addition to the \"check all maps\" command, you can also "
"check an individual map with the following ``curl`` command, substituting"
" the id of the row from the ``maplayermetadata`` table::"
