"The Manage Users table gives the network administrator a list of all user"
" accounts in table form. You can access it by clicking the \"Manage "
"Users\" button on the :doc:`dashboard`, which is linked from the header "
"of all Dataverse pages (if you're logged in as an administrator). It "

"or not they have Superuser status."

"Users are listed alphabetically by username. The input labelled \"Search "

"\"baseba\", e.g. \"baseball\" or \"baseballfan\"."
