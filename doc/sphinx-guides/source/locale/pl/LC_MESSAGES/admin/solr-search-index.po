"Dataverse requires Solr to be operational at all times. If you stop Solr,"
" you should see a error about this on the home page, which is powered by "
"the search index Solr provides. You can set up Solr by following the "
"steps in our Installation Guide's :doc:`/installation/prerequisites` and "
":doc:`/installation/config` sections explaining how to configure it. This"
" section you're reading now is about the care and feeding of the search "
"index. PostgreSQL is the \"source of truth\" and the Dataverse "
"application will copy data from PostgreSQL into Solr. For this reason, "
"the search index can be rebuilt at any time. Depending on the amount of "
"data you have, this can be a slow process. You are encouraged to "
"experiment with production data to get a sense of how long a full "
"reindexing will take."
