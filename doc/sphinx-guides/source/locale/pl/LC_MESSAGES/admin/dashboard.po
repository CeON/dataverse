"Dataverse offers a dashboard of administrative tools for superusers only."
" If you are a logged-in superuser, you can access it by clicking your "
"username in the navbar, and then clicking \"Dashboard\" from the "
"dropdown. You can verify that you are a superuser by checking the color "
"of your username in the navbar. If it's red, you have the right "
"permissions to use the Dashboard. Superusers can give other users the "
"superuser status via :doc:`user-administration`."
