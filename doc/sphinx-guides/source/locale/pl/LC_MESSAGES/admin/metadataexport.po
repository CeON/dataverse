"Publishing a dataset automatically starts a metadata export job, that "
"will run in the background, asynchronously. Once completed, it will make "
"the dataset metadata exported and cached in all the supported formats "

"This timer is activated automatically on the deployment, or restart, of "
"the application. So, again, no need to start or configure it manually. "

"An export batch job, whether started via the API, or by the application "

"name of the log file is ``export_[timestamp].log`` - for example, "
"*export_2016-08-23T03-35-23.log*. The log will contain the numbers of "
"datasets processed successfully and those for which metadata export "
"failed, with some information on the failures detected. Please attach "
"this log file if you need to contact Dataverse support about metadata "
"export problems."
