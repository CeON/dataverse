"**Important:** The installer will need to use the PostgreSQL command line"
" utility ``psql`` in order to configure the database. If the executable "
"is not in your system PATH, the installer will try to locate it on your "
"system. However, we strongly recommend that you check and make sure it is"
" in the PATH. This is especially important if you have multiple versions "
"of PostgreSQL installed on your system. Make sure the psql that came with"
" the version that you want to use with your Dataverse is the first on "
"your path. For example, if the PostgreSQL distribution you are running is"
" installed in  /Library/PostgreSQL/9.6, add /Library/PostgreSQL/9.6/bin "
"to the beginning of your $PATH variable. If you are *running* multiple "
"PostgreSQL servers, make sure you know the port number of the one you "
"want to use, as the installer will need it in order to connect to the "
"database (the first PostgreSQL distribution installed on your system is "
"likely using the default port 5432; but the second will likely be on "
"5433, etc.) Does every word in this paragraph make sense? If it does, "
"great - because you definitely need to be comfortable with basic system "
"tasks in order to install Dataverse. If not - if you don't know how to "
"check where your PostgreSQL is installed, or what port it is running on, "
"or what a $PATH is... it's not too late to stop. Because it will most "
"likely not work. And if you contact us for help, these will be the "
"questions we'll be asking you - so, again, you need to be able to answer "
"them comfortably for it to work."
