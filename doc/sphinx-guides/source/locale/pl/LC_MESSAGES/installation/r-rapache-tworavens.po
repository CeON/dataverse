"TwoRavens is a web application for tabular data exploration and "
"statistical analysis. It can be integrated with Dataverse, as an "
"**optional** component.  While TwoRavens was originally created at IQSS, "
"its developers have since left the organization. Plans for the future of "
"the Dataverse/TwoRavens collaboration are still being worked out. As "
"such, **support for TwoRavens is somewhat limited at the moment (as of "
"Spring of 2017).**"

"TwoRavens will need to obtain some tabular-data-specific metadata from "
"Dataverse -- the DDI fragment that describes the variables and some pre-"
"processed summary statistics for the data vectors. In order to produce "
"the latter, the Dataverse application also needs to be able to execute "
"some R code on the server. Instead of ``rApache``, Dataverse uses `Rserve"
" <https://rforge.net/Rserve/>`_ to communicate to R. Rserve is installed "
"as a \"contributor\" R package. It runs as a daemon process on the "
"server, accepting network connections on a dedicated port. Dataverse "
"project supplies an :fixedwidthplain:`init.d`-style startup file for the "
"daemon. The R setup in step :ref:`tworavens_install_r_packages` will set "

"In addition to Rserve, there are 14 more R library packages that the "
"TwoRavens R code requires in order to run. These in turn require 30 more "
"as their own dependencies, so a total of 45 packages must be installed. "
"\"Installed\" in the context of an R package means R must download the "
"**source code** from the `CRAN <https://cran.r-project.org/>`_ code "
"repository and compile it locally. This historically has been the "
"trickiest, least stable part of the installation process, since the "
"packages in question are being constantly (and independently) developed. "
"This means that every time you attempt to install these packages, you are"
" building from potentially different versions of the source code. An "
"incompatibility introduced between any two of the packages can result in "
"a failure to install. In this release we have attempted to resolve this "
"by installing the **specific  versions of the R packages that have been "
"proven** to work together. If you have attempted to install TwoRavens in "
"the past, and it didn't work, please see the part of section "
":ref:`prerequisites_r` where we explain how to completely erase all the "
