" Geographic Analysis (CGA) at Harvard and is open source software that "

"tabular files to Dataverse for long term storage and receive a persistent"

"Geoconnect is a platform that integrates Dataverse and WorldMap, allowing"
" researchers to visualize their geospatial data. Geoconnect can be used "
"to create maps of shapefiles or of tabular files containing geospatial "
"information. Geoconnect is an optional component of Dataverse, so if you "
"are interested in this feature but don't see it in the installation of "
"Dataverse you are using, you should contact the support team for that "
"installation and ask them to enable the Geoconnect feature."
