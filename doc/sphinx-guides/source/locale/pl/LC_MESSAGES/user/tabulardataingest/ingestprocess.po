"The goal of our ingest process is to extract the data content from the "
"user's files and archive it in an application-neutral, easily-readable "
"format. What does this mean? - Commercial applications such as SPSS and "
"Stata use their own, proprietary formats to encode their files. Some "
"companies publish the specifications of their formats (Thank you Stata - "
"much appreciated!), some don't (SPSS - yes, we are still frowning at you "
"here at the Dataverse Project). Either way, reading these specially-"
"formatted files requires some extra knowledge or special software. For "
"these reasons they are not considered ideal for the purposes of archival "
"preservation. Dataverse stores the raw data content extracted from such "
"files in plain text, TAB-delimited files. The metadata information that "
"describes this content is stored separately, in a relational database, so"
" that it can be accessed efficiently by the application. For the purposes"
" of archival preservation it can be exported, in plain text XML files, "
"using a standardized, open `DDI Codebook "
"<http://www.ddialliance.org/Specification/DDI-Codebook/2.5/>`_ format."

"A simple example is a numeric data column in a user's Stata file that "
"contains 0s and 1s. These numeric values will be extracted and stored in "
"a TAB-delimited file. By themselves, if you don't know what these values "
"represent, these 1s and 0s are not meaningful data. So the Stata file has"
" some additional information that describes this data vector: it "
"represents the observation values of a *variable* with the *name* "
"\"party\"; with a descriptive *label* \"Party Affiliation\"; and the 2 "
"numeric values have *categorical labels* of \"Democrat\" for 0 and "
"\"Republican\" for 1. This extra information that adds value to the data "
"is *metadata*."
