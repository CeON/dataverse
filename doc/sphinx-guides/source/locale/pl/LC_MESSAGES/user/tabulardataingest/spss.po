"SPSS does not openly publish the specifications of their proprietary file"
" formats. Our ability to read and parse their files is based on some "
"documentation online from unofficial sources, and some reverse "
"engineering. Because of that we cannot, unfortunately, guarantee to be "
"able to process *any* SPSS file uploaded."

"However, we've been improving this process for a few years by now, and it"
" should be quite robust in the current version of Dataverse. Thus your "
"chances of success - uploading an SPSS files and having it turned into a "
"fully functional tabular data table in the Dataverse - should be "
"reasonably good."

"In the past, there have been attempts to support SPSS \"control cards\", "
"in addition to the .SAV and .POR files; both in the early VDC software, "
"and in some versions of DVN. A \"control card\" is a plain text file with"
" a set of SPSS commands that describe the raw data, provided in a "
"separate, fixed-width-columns or comma-separated-values file. For various"
" reasons, it has never been very successful. We weren't seeing too much "
"demand for this ingest feature, so it was dropped from Dataverse 4.0."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/user/tabulardataingest/spss.rst:38
msgid ""
"Historically, there was no support for specifying a particular "
"language/code page encoding for the data stored in an SPSS file. Meaning,"
" text values in none-ASCII encodings, or non-Latin characters could be "
"entered and stored, but there was no setting to unambiguously specify "
"what language, or what character set it was. By default, Dataverse will "
"try to interpret binary characters as UTF8. If that's not working - for "
"example, if the descriptive labels and/or categorical values ingest as "
"garbage - and if you happen to know what encoding was used in the "
"original file, you can now specify it in the Ingest Options."
