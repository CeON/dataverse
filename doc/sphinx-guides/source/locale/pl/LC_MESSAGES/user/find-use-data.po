" drive, for example) then you can find it at the folder path under "
"**Local Access**. Otherwise, to download the Dataverse Package you will "
"have to use one of the rsync commands under **Download Access**. There "
"may be multiple commands listed, each corresponding to a different mirror"
" that hosts the Dataverse Package. Go outside your browser and open a "
"terminal (AKA command line) window on your computer. Use the terminal to "
"run the command that corresponds with the mirror of your choice. It's "
