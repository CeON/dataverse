This is how to install sphinx: 

Guide will cover sphinx installation inside python virtual environment.
Python virtual environments are helpful to ensure that everyone uses
the same versions of packages. It also helps in maintaining what
packages are installed for each project. It resolves  
Guide assumes that user is using debian like operating system.
If you are using some other operating system then you
can find some tips in additional links. 


# Create virtual environment in directory `env`
python3 -m venv env
# Activate created environment
source env/bin/activate
# Install sphinx (and possibly other required packages)
pip install -r requirements.txt

This is all you need. You should now be able to build HTML/pdf documentation from git sources locally. 

And this is how you build: 

make html

in this directory will generate html files, and leave them in the build subdirectory here. 

To build documentation in non default language (if available) you need to
use additional param:

make -e SPHINXOPTS="-D language='pl'" html

To have it build the html files AND deploy them under your glassfish environment, type

make htmldeploy

For this the Makefile assumes that your glassfish is in /usr/local/glassfish4.

If it's installed elsewhere, you need to specify the directory on the command line, 
for example, like this:

make htmldeploy DOCROOT=/Applications/NetBeans/glassfish-4.1/glassfish/domains/domain1/docroot



Every time when there is some change in documentation the following should
be executed to ensure that translation files are fresh

make gettext
sphinx-intl update -p build/locale -l pl


To deactivate virtual evironment run

deactivate
