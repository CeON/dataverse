        This dataset was produced within the framework of the Making Electoral Democracy Work project.
        It
        contains pre-election and post-election survey data from the 2012 provincial election in Quebec.
        Making
        Electoral Democracy Work (MEDW) is an international collaborative project that was conducted
        between
        2009 and 2017 by a large team of political scientists, economists, and psychologists from
        Canada,
        Europe, and the United States. Its goal was to examine how the rules of the game (especially the
        electoral system) and the electoral context (especially the competitiveness and salience of the
        election) influence the dynamic and reciprocal relationship between voters and parties. To do
        so, the
        project gathered data for different types of elections held in Canada, France, Germany, Spain,
        and
        Switzerland between 2010 and 2016. In each country, two subnational units, typically regions,
        were
        studied. The analyses were complemented by laboratory and online experiments, as well as data on
        the
        parties’ campaigns. A selection of the project publications can be found at
        http://electoraldemocracy.com/publications. For more information on the project visit the
        project
